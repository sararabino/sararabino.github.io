I’m a fifth-year PhD student in Economics at the University of Zurich, supervised by [Ana Costa-Ramón](https://sites.google.com/view/anamariacostaramon) and [Roberto A. Weber](https://www.robertoweber.com). I work at the intersection of behavioral and labor economics, with a focus on education and gender inequalities.

I am currently visiting Harvard University, hosted by [Katherine Coffman](https://sites.google.com/site/kbaldigacoffman/).

Happy to Connect!
